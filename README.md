# Introduction

Hey! I'm Joey, a senior at Lake Travis High School. This folder contains some of the projects that I've done over the years in Python and Verilog, though some are still stuck on Replit, Code.org, or simply not saved anywhere anymore. It's a bummer, but that's just how life works.

If you're not reading this on Github, this is [my Github!](https://github.com/joeychild) It's relatively new (at the time of writing this README), but hopefully, I'll start adding some more of my old (and new!) programs and projects here.

Keep in mind that this is an archive! My more significant projects (as of now) are linked here:
[Gomoku in Turtle](https://github.com/joeychild/gomoku_turtle)
[Chess Bot](https://github.com/joeychild/chess)
[YT Downloader](https://github.com/joeychild/yt_downloader)

Other than that, have a great rest of your day! Hope you have a great time looking around here, and see you soon!

-Joey
